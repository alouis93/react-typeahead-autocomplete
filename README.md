# react-typeahead-autocomplete

Sample React (JSX) project that uses Typeahead.js to populate autocomplete suggestions using the Google Places JS library.

## Caveats

The [typeahead-addresspicker](https://github.com/sgruhier/typeahead-addresspicker) provides the datasource that ties into the
Google Places JS library. 

This is probably an issue with the import itself, but it didn't seem to activate when the latest typeahead.js version was used. 
This sample uses typeahead **v0.10.4**. The project is currently at **v0.11.1**. 

## TODO 

Tie into with updated typeahead version.
